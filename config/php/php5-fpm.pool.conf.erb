;;; Traffic selection
; You may use either -lowtraffic, -medtraffic, or -hightraffic here
; (or override with your own PM options for full customisability.)
;
; This will define how many PM processes are spawned for listening
; for PHP requests. To save memory, use as few as you need for the
; expected *dynamic* traffic load. (A popular static site may not
; actually invoke PHP that often. A moderately popular site which
; isn't cachable will need more capacity.)
;
; In our configuration, PHP listeners are by far the largest per-site
; memory drain, so it pays to tweak, test, and get this right.
